After Centaur's aborted first flight, President John F. Kennedy demanded to know what NASA hoped
to achieve with Centaur. Administrator James Webb's response was unequivocal. With the
Apollo program already committed to using liquid hydrogen in the upper stages of the giant
Saturn vehicle, Centaur would prove the fiael's feasibility.' The Agency was also counting on
Atlas-Centaur to launch Surveyor, a robotic spacecraft with a mission to determine whether the
Moon's surface was hard enough to land future spacecraft with human beings aboard.

Despite criticism and early technical failures, the taming of liquid hydrogen proved to
be one of NASA's most significant technical accomplishments. Centaur not only
succeeded in demonstrating the feasibility of liquid hydrogen as a rocket fuel, but it also
went on to a brilliant career as an upper stage for a series of spectacular planetary missions
in the 1970s. Ironically, this success did little to ensure the future of the Centaur rocket.
Once the Shuttle became operational in the early 1980s, all expendable launch vehicles
like Centaur were slated for termination. Centaur advocates fought to keep the program
alive. They won funding for the redesign of Centaur as an upper stage for the Shuttle, spent
nearly $1 billion integrate them, and then witnessed the cancellation of the program within
weeks of the first scheduled flight of Shuttle/Centaur.

Miraculously, Centaur survived into the commercial era of the 1990s and is still flying as
the upper stage for the Atlas. Although unthinkable at the height of the Cold War, the idea of
privatizing the delivery of launch vehicle services gained currency in the early 1980s because it
dovetailed with the free-enterprise, small-government ideology of the Reagan administration.
Now NASA is just a customer-albeit a favored one— of- a new service that rocket manufacturers
offer to a variety of customers, including foreign governments. A competitor of the European
Ariane rocket and the Boeing Delta, Centaur continues as the upper stage for a redesigned
Lockheed Martin Atlas.

Centaur's importance in the history of rocketry has escaped most historians of the space
program. One reason is that upper stage rockets compose the murky middle phases of space-
flight that rarely make news headlines. They do not create the dramatic plumes of fire that the
public sees on the launch pads at Kennedy Space Center. Nor do they carry space probes all the
way to the distant planets. The booster or first stage of a multistage rocket uses the brute force
of its large rocket engines to propel the stages and payload through the atmosphere. Once the
booster has used up its propellants, it is jettisoned rather than burdening the remaining stages
with the weight of a spent rocket. At this point. Centaur takes over. The role of the upper stage
is brief-usually about 10 minutes of glory between the shutdown of the booster engines and the
release of the spacecraft or satellite. Centaur's final task is simply to get out of the way, while the
payload— the spacecraft— is just beginning its (often multiyear) journey.
